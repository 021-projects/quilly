Quill comes ready to use in several convenient forms.

## CDN

A globally distributed and available CDN is provided, backed by [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).
This is the most convenience way to get started with Quill, and requires no build steps or package managers.

### Full Build

For most users, the full build is the easiest way to get started with Quill.
It include the core Quill library, as well as common themes, formats, and modules.

To import the full build, you will need to include "quill.js" script and the stylesheet for the theme you wish to use.

<Sandpack
  files={{
    "index.html": `
<script src="{{site.cdn}}/quill.js"></script>
<link href="{{site.cdn}}/quill.snow.css" rel="stylesheet">

<div id="editor">
  <h2>Demo Content</h2>
  <p>Preset build with <code>snow</code> theme, and some common formats.</p>
</div>

<script>
  const quill = new Quill('#editor', {
    theme: 'snow'
  });
</script>
    `
  }}
/>

### Core Build

To fully customize your Quill build, you can import the core library and add only the formats and modules you need.

<Sandpack
  files={{
    "index.html": `
<link href="{{site.cdn}}/quill.core.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="{{site.cdn}}/quill.core.js"></script>

<div id="editor">
  <p>Core build with no theme, formatting, non-essential modules</p>
</div>

<script>
  const quill = new Quill('#editor');
</script>
    `
  }}
/>

<Hint>

## NPM

If your project uses bundlers such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), it's recommended to install Quill via NPM.

```bash
npm install quill@{{site.version}}
```

Similar to the CDN approach, you can import the preset build or the core build.

```js
import Quill from 'quill';
// Or import Quill from 'quill/core'; if you only want to import the core build

const quill = new Quill('#editor');
```
