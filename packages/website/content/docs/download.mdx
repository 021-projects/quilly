### CDN

A globally distributed and available CDN is provided, backed by [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).

```html
<!-- Main Quill library -->
<script src="{{site.cdn}}/quill.js"></script>
<script src="{{site.cdn}}/quill.min.js"></script>

<!-- Theme included stylesheets -->
<link href="{{site.cdn}}/quill.snow.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="{{site.cdn}}/quill.bubble.css" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- Core build with no theme, formatting, non-essential modules -->
<link href="{{site.cdn}}/quill.core.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="{{site.cdn}}/quill.core.js"></script>
```

### NPM

Add Quill as an [NPM](//www.npmjs.org/) dependency and add it your own build workflow, or use the included built options. Compiled stylesheets are also included in `umd/` folder.

```bash
npm install quill@{{site.version}}
```

### Direct Download
